This module extends the standard functionality of Odoo's CRM, Sales Order and Project Category modules. Key features include:

1. **Codename generation for leads**: Automatically generate lead names using a sequence and the codename field.
2. **Criteria field validation**: When moving leads to certain stages, required criteria fields must be completed, ensuring the opportunity is fully qualified.
3. **Analytic account linking**: For each lead, an analytic account can be created or linked, simplifying financial tracking of proposals.
4. **Attachment management in Sales Orders**: Documents can be attached to leads and sales orders for better record-keeping and client communication.

**Key Features**:
- Mandatory criteria validation for certain stages in CRM.
- Simplified financial tracking by linking leads to analytic accounts.
- Ability to attach supporting documents to both leads and sales orders.

These enhancements ensure that all critical information is filled out before advancing leads and streamline the sales approval process by including financial and documentation support.

Configuration
=============

This module requires a few configurations to ensure smooth operation:

1. Navigate to **CRM > Settings**.
2. Enable the option **Validate Criteria Fields** in CRM stages. This ensures that when moving a lead to a particular stage, all criteria fields must be filled in.
3. For each opportunity, ensure that an analytic account is either created or linked. This allows for financial tracking of proposals.
4. In the Sales Order configuration, you can allow attachments for additional documentation to support the lead or sales process.

Usage
=====

This module enhances the workflow in CRM and Sales by adding features like criteria validation and analytic account linkage.

**Create a lead with codename**

1. Navigate to the CRM and create a new lead.
2. Fill in the **Codename** field, which is mandatory.
3. The lead name will be automatically generated based on the sequence and the codename.
4. Move the lead to the next stage as per your workflow. Some stages may require all criteria fields to be filled before proceeding.

**Work with criteria fields**

- While managing leads, the following criteria fields will be validated before you can move the lead to the next stage (if configured):
  * **Interesting Client**: Indicates if the client is interesting.
  * **Adequate Documentation**: Ensures documentation is present.
  * **Appropriate Equipment**: Confirms equipment availability.
  * **Financial Viability**: Confirms financial feasibility.
  * **Technological Risks**: Checks if risks are acceptable.

**Generate a Quotation**

1. After qualifying the lead, generate a quotation.
2. If no analytic account is linked to the lead, a wizard will appear, allowing you to create or associate an analytic account.
3. Once the account is linked, the quotation can proceed.

**Manage Sales Order Attachments**

1. When creating a sales order, attach relevant documents such as PDFs or URLs to support your proposal or sale.
2. These attachments can be linked to both the lead and the sales order for tracking purposes.
