This module extends the standard functionality of Odoo's CRM, Sales Order and Project Category modules. Key features include:

1. **Codename generation for leads**: Automatically generate lead names using a sequence and the codename field.
2. **Criteria field validation**: When moving leads to certain stages, required criteria fields must be completed, ensuring the opportunity is fully qualified.
3. **Analytic account linking**: For each lead, an analytic account can be created or linked, simplifying financial tracking of proposals.
4. **Attachment management in Sales Orders**: Documents can be attached to leads and sales orders for better record-keeping and client communication.

**Key Features**:
- Mandatory criteria validation for certain stages in CRM.
- Simplified financial tracking by linking leads to analytic accounts.
