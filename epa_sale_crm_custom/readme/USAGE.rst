This module enhances the workflow in CRM and Sales by adding features like criteria validation and analytic account linkage.

**Create a lead with codename**

1. Navigate to the CRM and create a new lead.
2. Fill in the **Codename** field, which is mandatory.
3. The lead name will be automatically generated based on the sequence and the codename.
4. Move the lead to the next stage as per your workflow. Some stages may require all criteria fields to be filled before proceeding.

**Work with criteria fields**

- While managing leads, the following criteria fields will be validated before you can move the lead to the next stage (if configured):
  * **Interesting Client**: Indicates if the client is interesting.
  * **Adequate Documentation**: Ensures documentation is present.
  * **Appropriate Equipment**: Confirms equipment availability.
  * **Financial Viability**: Confirms financial feasibility.
  * **Technological Risks**: Checks if risks are acceptable.

**Generate a Quotation**

1. After qualifying the lead, generate a quotation.
2. If no analytic account is linked to the lead, a wizard will appear, allowing you to create or associate an analytic account.
3. Once the account is linked, the quotation can proceed.

**Manage Sales Order Attachments**

1. When creating a sales order, attach relevant documents such as PDFs or URLs to support your proposal or sale.
2. These attachments can be linked to both the lead and the sales order for tracking purposes.
