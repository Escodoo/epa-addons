This module requires a few configurations to ensure smooth operation:

1. Navigate to **CRM > Settings**.
2. Enable the option **Validate Criteria Fields** in CRM stages. This ensures that when moving a lead to a particular stage, all criteria fields must be filled in.
3. For each opportunity, ensure that an analytic account is either created or linked. This allows for financial tracking of proposals.
4. In the Sales Order configuration, you can allow attachments for additional documentation to support the lead or sales process.
